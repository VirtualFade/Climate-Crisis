            <p>
                Over the past decade, California has been suffering from severe drought conditions, often classified as <strong>exceptional drought</strong>—the most extreme level. Between <strong>2012 and 2016</strong>, California faced some of its lowest points in history, with devastating impacts on agriculture, wildlife, and communities. Around <strong>102 million trees</strong> have died due to the drought, significantly affecting the environment and wildlife habitats. This has made recovery difficult for ecosystems and intensified the risk of wildfires. By <strong>2023</strong>, drought conditions worsened again, but by <strong>2025</strong>, the situation has started to improve, offering some relief.
            </p>
            <p>
                California is the world’s fifth-largest agricultural supplier. The drought has made it harder for farmers to grow crops, as many of them rely heavily on water. These conditions have led to increased food prices and economic hardships in agricultural communities. Additionally, dry conditions have contributed to a higher likelihood of wildfires. For instance, one of the most significant fire events occurred in LA in early January 2025.

                California is actively working to mitigate the impact of drought through various initiatives to increase water retention and prevent future droughts. Some of these measures include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Groundwater storage</strong> expansion to improve water reserves.</li>
                <li>Maximizing <strong>stormwater capture</strong> to store excess rainwater for dry periods.</li>
                <li>Implementing <strong>conservation requirements</strong> for businesses to reduce water consumption.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition to state-level efforts, individual citizens can also play a significant role in preventing drought by practicing water conservation. Some practical ways to help include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Taking <strong>shorter showers</strong> to reduce water waste.</li>
                <li>Turning off water when not in use, such as while brushing teeth or washing dishes.</li>
                <li>Fixing <strong>water leaks</strong> promptly to prevent wastage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These simple actions, when adopted by millions of people, can contribute greatly to reducing California’s water usage in the long term.
