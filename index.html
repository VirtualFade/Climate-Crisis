        <h2>Drought In The Past Decade</h2>

                For the past decade, California has been suffering a severe case of drought. Images show California's
                conditions to be that of exceptional drought, the lowest on the scaling. In the past decade, around 102
                million trees have died due to drought in California. With 2012 to 2016 being one of the lowest points
                in California history to be impacted by drought. Drought conditions would rise in 2023, however, it would appear that
                as of 2025, conditions are falling again. Drought is a serious issue as it leads to many problems for the citizens of California
                as well as the wildlife. California is the world's fifth largest agricultural supplier, meaning many farmers who require water to grow their crops.
                Farmers have to deal with water shortage, making it more difficult to grow and sell crops. Wildfire's also have a higher chance of 
                occurring due to dry conditions, with one of these large-scale events being the fires in LA occurring the beginning of January 2025.

        <h2>Relieving and Preventing Drought</h2>

            <p>California has been taking steps to increase water retention and prevent drought conditions from worsening. There have been
                more investments in infrastructure such as increasing groundwater storage and maximizing stormwater capture. California
                has also established conservation requirements to businesses around the state. There are also many ways for us as citizens
                to help prevent drought by practicing water conservation. Many have seen commercials describe taking shorter showers,
                turning off water when not in use, and making sure to fix water leaks as just a few available options. These are all still true,
                and can be very helpful to California in the long run.
